# Agent Development Guidelines

## RULE 1 – ABSOLUTE (DO NOT EVER VIOLATE THIS)

You may NOT delete any file or directory unless I explicitly give the exact command **in this session**.

- This includes files you just created (tests, tmp files, scripts, etc.).
- You do not get to decide that something is “safe” to remove.
- If you think something should be removed, stop and ask. You must receive clear written approval **before** any deletion command is even proposed.

Treat “never delete files without permission” as a hard invariant.

---

### IRREVERSIBLE GIT & FILESYSTEM ACTIONS

Absolutely forbidden unless I give the **exact command and explicit approval** in the same message:

- `git reset --hard`
- `git clean -fd`
- `rm -rf`
- Any command that can delete or overwrite code/data

Rules:

1. If you are not 100% sure what a command will delete, do not propose or run it. Ask first.
2. Prefer safe tools: `git status`, `git diff`, `git stash`, copying to backups, etc.
3. After approval, restate the command verbatim, list what it will affect, and wait for confirmation.
4. When a destructive command is run, record in your response:
   - The exact user text authorizing it
   - The command run
   - When you ran it

If that audit trail is missing, then you must act as if the operation never happened.

---

### Code Editing Discipline

- Do **not** run scripts that bulk-modify code (codemods, invented one-off scripts, giant `sed`/regex refactors).
- Large mechanical changes: break into smaller, explicit edits and review diffs.
- Subtle/complex changes: edit by hand, file-by-file, with careful reasoning.

---

### Backwards Compatibility & File Sprawl

We optimize for a clean architecture now, not backwards compatibility.

- No “compat shims” or “v2” file clones.
- When changing behavior, migrate callers and remove old code.
- New files are only for genuinely new domains that don’t fit existing modules.
- The bar for adding files is very high.

---

## Development Commands

Use these make targets for all checks and tests:

```bash
make check       # Run linting and static analysis (quiet output)
make test        # Run all tests (quiet output)
make check-test  # Run both checks and tests

# Verbose output when debugging failures
make check VERBOSE=1
make test VERBOSE=1
```

## Quick Reference: bd Commands

```bash
# Adding comments - use subcommand syntax, NOT flags
bd comments add <issue-id> "comment text"   # CORRECT
bd comments <issue-id> --add "text"         # WRONG - --add is not a flag

# Labels
bd label add <issue-id> <label>
bd label remove <issue-id> <label>
```

---

### Third-Party Libraries

When unsure of an API, look up current docs (late-2025) rather than guessing.

---

## Available Tools

### ripgrep (rg)
Fast code search tool available via command line. Common patterns:
- `rg "pattern"` - search all files
- `rg "pattern" -t go` - search only Go files
- `rg "pattern" -g "*.go"` - search files matching glob
- `rg "pattern" -l` - list matching files only
- `rg "pattern" -C 3` - show 3 lines of context

### ast-grep (sg)
Structural code search using AST patterns. Use when text search is fragile (formatting varies, need semantic matches).
```bash
sg -p 'func $NAME($$$) { $$$BODY }' -l swift    # Find functions
sg -p '$VAR.transform($$$)' -l swift            # Find method calls
```

## MCP Agent Mail — Multi-Agent Coordination

Agent Mail is available as an MCP server for coordinating work across agents.

What Agent Mail gives:
- Identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads.
- Advisory file reservations (leases) to avoid agents clobbering each other.
- Persistent artifacts in git (human-auditable).

Core patterns:

1. **Same repo**
   - Register identity:
     - `ensure_project` then `register_agent` with the repo's absolute path as `project_key`.
   - Reserve files before editing:
     - `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)`.
   - Communicate:
     - `send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")`.
     - `fetch_inbox`, then `acknowledge_message`.
   - Fast reads:
     - `resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20`.
     - `resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true`.

2. **Macros vs granular:**
   - Prefer macros when speed is more important than fine-grained control:
     - `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`.
   - Use granular tools when you need explicit behavior.

Common pitfalls:
- "from_agent not registered" → call `register_agent` with correct `project_key`.
- `FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT` → adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use non-exclusive reservation.

---

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

---

## Issue Tracking with Beads

We use beads for issue tracking and work planning. If you need more information, execute `bd quickstart`

**IMPORTANT**: Beads (`bd` CLI) is a third-party tool we do not maintain. Do not propose changes to the beads codebase. The beads source may be in a sibling folder for reference, but we cannot modify it.

### Dependencies
```bash
bd dep add <child> <parent> --type parent-child   # Make child a subtask of parent
bd dep add <blocked> <blocker> --type blocks      # blocker blocks blocked
bd dep remove <from> <to>                         # Remove dependency
```
**Note**: Use `bd dep add`, not `bd dep` directly. First arg depends on second arg.

### Bead ID Format
**IMPORTANT**: Always use standard bead IDs (e.g., `ab-xyz`, `ab-4aw`). Do NOT use dotted notation like `ab-4aw.1` or `ab-4aw.2` for bead names. Each bead should have its own unique ID from the beads system.

### Bead Workflow

#### When Starting Work
1. **Read the bead details**: Use `bd show <bead-id>` to view the full bead information
2. **Read the comments**: Use `bd comments <bead-id>` to read all comments on the bead
   - Comments often contain important context, analysis, or clarifications
   - Prior discussions may provide insights into requirements or constraints
   - Reviewers may have added specific guidance or considerations
3. **IMPORTANT!** Set the bead status to `in_progress` when you start work

#### Before Closing a Bead
You must complete ALL of the following steps before marking a bead as closed:

1. **Write Tests**: Write comprehensive tests for any code you added or changed
2. **Run Checks and Tests**: Run `make check-test` and fix all issues before committing
   - Remove unused variables and styles
   - Use `//nolint:unparam` only when parameter is used in tests
3. If you discover new work, create a new bead with `discovered-from:<parent-id>`.
4. **Commit Changes**: Only commit files you created or changed (use `git add <specific-files>`, not `git add .`)
5. Commit `.beads/` in the same commit as code changes.
6. **Push and Verify GitHub Build**: Push and wait for GitHub Actions build to pass before closing
7. **Comment on Bead**: Add a comment with summary and commit hash
8. **Close Bead**: Only after sucessful push

### Auto-sync:
- bd exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (debounced).
- It imports from JSONL when newer (e.g. after `git pull`).

### Never:
- Use markdown TODO lists.
- Use other trackers.
- Duplicate tracking.

### Parent Beads (Epics)
**IMPORTANT**: Do not mark parent beads as closed until ALL child beads are closed. Parent beads represent collections of work and can only be considered complete when all subtasks are finished.

### Working with Other Agents
Other agents may be working in parallel. Only commit files you created or changed - ignore other modified files.

### Testing Beads
If you need to create or modify beads to test some functionality, do it in a bead that is a child (or descendant) of ab-cj3. That is the test beads parent.

## Using bv as an AI sidecar

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects (.beads/beads.jsonl). Instead of parsing JSONL or hallucinating graph traversal, use robot flags for deterministic, dependency-aware outputs with precomputed metrics (PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS, eigenvector, k-core).

**Scope boundary:** bv handles *what to work on* (triage, priority, planning). For agent-to-agent coordination (messaging, work claiming, file reservations), use MCP Agent Mail, which should be available to you as an an MCP server (if it's not, then flag to the user; they might need to start Agent Mail using the `am` alias or by running `cd "<directory_where_they_installed_agent_mail>/mcp_agent_mail" && bash scripts/run_server_with_token.sh)' if the alias isn't available or isn't working.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Use ONLY `--robot-*` flags. Bare `bv` launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

#### The Workflow: Start With Triage

**`bv --robot-triage` is your single entry point.** It returns everything you need in one call:
- `quick_ref`: at-a-glance counts + top 3 picks
- `recommendations`: ranked actionable items with scores, reasons, unblock info
- `quick_wins`: low-effort high-impact items
- `blockers_to_clear`: items that unblock the most downstream work
- `project_health`: status/type/priority distributions, graph metrics
- `commands`: copy-paste shell commands for next steps

bv --robot-triage        # THE MEGA-COMMAND: start here
bv --robot-next          # Minimal: just the single top pick + claim command

#### Other bv Commands

**Planning:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with `unblocks` lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection with confidence |

**Graph Analysis:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-insights` | Full metrics: PageRank, betweenness, HITS (hubs/authorities), eigenvector, critical path, cycles, k-core, articulation points, slack |
| `--robot-label-health` | Per-label health: `health_level` (healthy\|warning\|critical), `velocity_score`, `staleness`, `blocked_count` |
| `--robot-label-flow` | Cross-label dependency: `flow_matrix`, `dependencies`, `bottleneck_labels` |
| `--robot-label-attention [--attention-limit=N]` | Attention-ranked labels by: (pagerank × staleness × block_impact) / velocity |

**History & Change Tracking:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-history` | Bead-to-commit correlations: `stats`, `histories` (per-bead events/commits/milestones), `commit_index` |
| `--robot-diff --diff-since <ref>` | Changes since ref: new/closed/modified issues, cycles introduced/resolved |

**Other Commands:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-burndown <sprint>` | Sprint burndown, scope changes, at-risk items |
| `--robot-forecast <id\|all>` | ETA predictions with dependency-aware scheduling |
| `--robot-alerts` | Stale issues, blocking cascades, priority mismatches |
| `--robot-suggest` | Hygiene: duplicates, missing deps, label suggestions, cycle breaks |
| `--robot-graph [--graph-format=json\|dot\|mermaid]` | Dependency graph export |
| `--export-graph <file.html>` | Self-contained interactive HTML visualization |

#### Scoping & Filtering

bv --robot-plan --label backend              # Scope to label's subgraph
bv --robot-insights --as-of HEAD~30          # Historical point-in-time
bv --recipe actionable --robot-plan          # Pre-filter: ready to work (no blockers)
bv --recipe high-impact --robot-triage       # Pre-filter: top PageRank scores
bv --robot-triage --robot-triage-by-track    # Group by parallel work streams
bv --robot-triage --robot-triage-by-label    # Group by domain

#### Understanding Robot Output

**All robot JSON includes:**
- `data_hash` — Fingerprint of source beads.jsonl (verify consistency across calls)
- `status` — Per-metric state: `computed|approx|timeout|skipped` + elapsed ms
- `as_of` / `as_of_commit` — Present when using `--as-of`; contains ref and resolved SHA

**Two-phase analysis:**
- **Phase 1 (instant):** degree, topo sort, density — always available immediately
- **Phase 2 (async, 500ms timeout):** PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, cycles — check `status` flags

**For large graphs (>500 nodes):** Some metrics may be approximated or skipped. Always check `status`.

#### jq Quick Reference

bv --robot-triage | jq '.quick_ref'                        # At-a-glance summary
bv --robot-triage | jq '.recommendations[0]'               # Top recommendation
bv --robot-plan | jq '.plan.summary.highest_impact'        # Best unblock target
bv --robot-insights | jq '.status'                         # Check metric readiness
bv --robot-insights | jq '.Cycles'                         # Circular deps (must fix!)
bv --robot-label-health | jq '.results.labels[] | select(.health_level == "critical")'

**Performance:** Phase 1 instant, Phase 2 async (500ms timeout). Prefer `--robot-plan` over `--robot-insights` when speed matters. Results cached by data hash.

Use bv instead of parsing beads.jsonl—it computes PageRank, critical paths, cycles, and parallel tracks deterministically.

### cass — Cross-Agent Search

`cass` indexes prior agent conversations (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.) so we can reuse solved problems.

Rules:

- Never run bare `cass` (TUI). Always use `--robot` or `--json`.

Examples:

```bash
cass health
cass search "authentication error" --robot --limit 5
cass view /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 --json
cass expand /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 -C 3 --json
cass capabilities --json
cass robot-docs guide
```

Tips:

- Use `--fields minimal` for lean output.
- Filter by agent with `--agent`.
- Use `--days N` to limit to recent history.

stdout is data-only, stderr is diagnostics; exit code 0 means success.

Treat cass as a way to avoid re-solving problems other agents already handled.

---

## Memory System: cass-memory

The Cass Memory System (cm) is a tool for giving agents an effective memory based on the ability to quickly search across previous coding agent sessions across an array of different coding agent tools (e.g., Claude Code, Codex, Gemini-CLI, Cursor, etc) and projects (and even across multiple machines, optionally) and then reflect on what they find and learn in new sessions to draw out useful lessons and takeaways; these lessons are then stored and can be queried and retrieved later, much like how human memory works.

The `cm onboard` command guides you through analyzing historical sessions and extracting valuable rules.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Check status and see recommendations
cm onboard status

# 2. Get sessions to analyze (filtered by gaps in your playbook)
cm onboard sample --fill-gaps

# 3. Read a session with rich context
cm onboard read /path/to/session.jsonl --template

# 4. Add extracted rules (one at a time or batch)
cm playbook add "Your rule content" --category "debugging"
# Or batch add:
cm playbook add --file rules.json

# 5. Mark session as processed
cm onboard mark-done /path/to/session.jsonl
```

Before starting complex tasks, retrieve relevant context:

```bash
cm context "<task description>" --json
```

This returns:
- **relevantBullets**: Rules that may help with your task
- **antiPatterns**: Pitfalls to avoid
- **historySnippets**: Past sessions that solved similar problems
- **suggestedCassQueries**: Searches for deeper investigation

### Protocol

1. **START**: Run `cm context "<task>" --json` before non-trivial work
2. **WORK**: Reference rule IDs when following them (e.g., "Following b-8f3a2c...")
3. **FEEDBACK**: Leave inline comments when rules help/hurt:
   - `// [cass: helpful b-xyz] - reason`
   - `// [cass: harmful b-xyz] - reason`
4. **END**: Just finish your work. Learning happens automatically.

### Key Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--json` | Machine-readable JSON output (required!) |
| `--limit N` | Cap number of rules returned |
| `--no-history` | Skip historical snippets for faster response |

stdout = data only, stderr = diagnostics. Exit 0 = success.

## UBS Quick Reference for AI Agents

UBS stands for "Ultimate Bug Scanner": **The AI Coding Agent's Secret Weapon: Flagging Likely Bugs for Fixing Early On**

**Golden Rule:** `ubs <changed-files>` before every commit. Exit 0 = safe. Exit >0 = fix & re-run.

**Commands:**
```bash
ubs file.ts file2.py                    # Specific files (< 1s) — USE THIS
ubs $(git diff --name-only --cached)    # Staged files — before commit
ubs --only=js,python src/               # Language filter (3-5x faster)
ubs --ci --fail-on-warning .            # CI mode — before PR
ubs --help                              # Full command reference
ubs sessions --entries 1                # Tail the latest install session log
ubs .                                   # Whole project (ignores things like .venv and node_modules automatically)
```

**Output Format:**
```
⚠️  Category (N errors)
    file.ts:42:5 – Issue description
    💡 Suggested fix
Exit code: 1
```
Parse: `file:line:col` → location | 💡 → how to fix | Exit 0/1 → pass/fail

**Fix Workflow:**
1. Read finding → category + fix suggestion
2. Navigate `file:line:col` → view context
3. Verify real issue (not false positive)
4. Fix root cause (not symptom)
5. Re-run `ubs <file>` → exit 0
6. Commit

**Speed Critical:** Scope to changed files. `ubs src/file.ts` (< 1s) vs `ubs .` (30s). Never full scan for small edits.

**Bug Severity:**
- **Critical** (always fix): Null safety, XSS/injection, async/await, memory leaks
- **Important** (production): Type narrowing, division-by-zero, resource leaks
- **Contextual** (judgment): TODO/FIXME, console logs

**Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ Ignore findings → ✅ Investigate each
- ❌ Full scan per edit → ✅ Scope to file
- ❌ Fix symptom (`if (x) { x.y }`) → ✅ Root cause (`x?.y`)

## Optimus Clip Project Guidelines

**Project Status:** Phase 0 (Scaffolding)
**Swift Version:** 6.0
**macOS Target:** 15.0+

### Project Overview

Optimus Clip is a macOS menu bar application that acts as intelligent clipboard middleware. It intercepts clipboard content via global hotkeys, transforms it using algorithmic rules or LLMs, and pastes the result.

**Bundle ID:** com.optimusclip
**Architecture:** SwiftUI + AppKit hybrid (menu bar + settings window)
**Concurrency Model:** Swift 6 strict concurrency with async/await

### Project Structure

```
optimus-clip/

```

**Why split OptimusClip and OptimusClipCore?**
- OptimusClip: Platform-specific (AppKit, SwiftUI, macOS APIs)
- OptimusClipCore: Pure Swift logic (testable, reusable, cross-platform potential)

### Build Commands

Use make targets for all checks and tests (quiet output, ~99% token savings for AI agents):

```bash
make check         # Run format check and lint (quiet output)
make test          # Run unit tests (quiet output)
make test-parallel # Run tests in parallel (quiet output)
make check-test    # Run both checks and tests
make format        # Auto-format code with swiftformat
make lint          # Run swiftlint with auto-fix
make build         # Build the project (debug)
make build-release # Build the project (release)
make package       # Package app (debug build)
make package-release # Package app (release build)
make clean         # Remove build artifacts
make start         # Compile and run the app
make stop          # Stop running app instances

# Verbose output when debugging failures
make test VERBOSE=1
make check VERBOSE=1
```

**Direct commands** (verbose output, use make targets above for quiet output):
```bash
swift build              # Build (debug)
swift test               # Run tests
swiftformat .            # Format code
swiftlint lint           # Lint code
```

**Before every commit:**
```bash
make check    # Must pass (no formatting/linting issues)
make test     # Must pass (all tests green)
```

**Version management:**
- Edit `version.env` to change version or build number
- Format: `MARKETING_VERSION="0.1.0"` and `BUILD_NUMBER="1"`
- Scripts read this file and populate Info.plist automatically

### Code Style Expectations

#### Swift 6 Concurrency
- **Always** use strict concurrency checking (enabled in Package.swift)
- Mark types as `Sendable` explicitly (struct, actor, or final class with immutable state)
- Use `@MainActor` for UI types (Views, ObservableObject)
- Never use `@unchecked Sendable` without detailed justification comment
- Prefer `async/await` over completion handlers

```swift
// ✅ GOOD
struct ClipboardContent: Sendable {
    let text: String
    let timestamp: Date
}

@MainActor
final class SettingsViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var apiKey: String = ""
}

// ❌ BAD
class ClipboardContent {  // Missing Sendable, should be struct
    var text: String
}
```

#### Value Types Over Reference Types
- **Prefer `struct`** for data models and transformations
- Use `class` only when:
  - Need reference semantics (shared mutable state)
  - Inheriting from Cocoa classes (NSObject, NSView)
  - Managing system resources (file handles, timers)

#### Explicit Self
- **Always use `self.`** in closures (required by SwiftFormat config)
- This prevents subtle capture bugs and aids Swift 6 concurrency checking

```swift
// ✅ GOOD
Task {
    let result = await self.transform(self.input)
}

// ❌ BAD (will fail swiftformat)
Task {
    let result = await transform(input)
}
```

#### Formatting
- **Indent:** 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line length:** 120 characters max
- Run `npm run format` before committing

#### Formatter/Linter Conflicts
When swiftformat and swiftlint conflict, **fix in config files** (`.swiftformat`, `.swiftlint.yml`)—never use `// swiftlint:disable` comments.

### Testing Guidelines

#### Framework
- Use **Swift Testing** framework (not XCTest) for new tests
- Async tests fully supported via `@Test` attribute
- Test Core library thoroughly (transformations, LLM clients)

#### Structure
```swift
import Testing
@testable import OptimusClipCore

@Suite("Transformation Tests")
struct TransformationTests {
    @Test("Whitespace stripping removes leading spaces")
    func testWhitespaceStripping() async throws {
        let transform = WhitespaceStripTransformation()
        let input = "  Hello\n  World"
        let output = try await transform.transform(input)
        #expect(output == "Hello\nWorld")
    }
}
```

#### Running Tests
```bash
npm run test              # Run all tests
swift test --filter "TransformationTests"  # Run specific suite
```

### Safety Guards

#### Never Commit
- API keys or secrets (use Keychain, not hardcoded strings)
- Absolute paths from your machine (`/Users/yourname/...`)
- Debug print statements (`print()`, `dump()`)

#### Always Test Before Push
```bash
npm run check    # Format and lint
npm run test     # All tests pass
npm run start    # App launches without crash
```

#### Never Auto-Release
- Don't create GitHub releases without explicit approval
- Don't bump version numbers autonomously
- Don't run signing/notarization scripts without request

### Architecture Patterns

#### Protocol-Oriented Design
Define protocols for core abstractions:
```swift
protocol Transformation: Sendable {
    func transform(_ input: String) async throws -> String
}
```

#### Dependency Injection
Pass dependencies explicitly, avoid singletons:
```swift
// ✅ GOOD
struct LLMTransformation: Transformation {
    let client: LLMClient
    func transform(_ input: String) async throws -> String {
        try await client.complete(input)
    }
}

// ❌ BAD
struct LLMTransformation {
    func transform(_ input: String) async throws -> String {
        try await OpenAIClient.shared.complete(input)  // Singleton
    }
}
```

### Common Operations

#### Adding a New Transformation
1. Create new struct in `Sources/OptimusClipCore/Transformations/`
2. Conform to `Transformation` protocol
3. Mark as `Sendable`
4. Add tests in `Tests/OptimusClipTests/`
5. Run `npm run check` and `npm run test`

#### Adding a New LLM Provider
1. Create client in `Sources/OptimusClipCore/LLMClients/`
2. Define async methods for API calls
3. Store credentials in Keychain (Phase 6) or @AppStorage (Phase 0-5)
4. Add provider section to Settings UI

### Security Considerations

#### API Keys
- **Phase 0-5:** Store in `@AppStorage` (UserDefaults) as placeholder
- **Phase 6:** Migrate to macOS Keychain via Security framework
- Never log API keys

#### Accessibility Permission
- Required for global hotkeys and paste simulation
- Check with `AXIsProcessTrusted()`
- Request with `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions()`

### Troubleshooting

#### Build Fails
- Check Swift version: `swift --version` (should be 6.0+)
- Check Xcode: `xcode-select -p` (should point to Xcode.app)
- Clean build: `swift package clean && swift build`

#### Tests Fail
- Check imports: `@testable import OptimusClipCore`
- Check test target in Package.swift
- Run verbose: `swift test --verbose`

#### Format/Lint Fails
- Auto-fix: `npm run format && npm run lint`
- If still fails, read error messages carefully

#### App Won't Launch
- Kill existing instances: `npm run stop`
- Check binary exists: `ls -l .build/debug/OptimusClip`
- Run directly: `.build/debug/OptimusClip`

### Phase Roadmap

- **Phase 0 (Current):** Project scaffolding, tooling setup
- **Phase 1:** Menu bar UI
- **Phase 2:** Clipboard monitoring
- **Phase 3:** Hotkeys + Settings
- **Phase 4:** Algorithmic transformations
- **Phase 5:** LLM integration
- **Phase 6:** Keychain + Launch at login
- **Phase 7:** Code signing + auto-updates

### Questions to Ask Before Acting

1. "Does this change require a test?"
2. "Does this follow Swift 6 concurrency rules?"
3. "Is this a value type or reference type? Why?"
4. "Should this be in OptimusClip or OptimusClipCore?"
5. "Will this pass swiftformat and swiftlint?"
6. "Is this security-sensitive? (API keys, clipboard, permissions)"
